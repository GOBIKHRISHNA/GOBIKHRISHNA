Project Overview:
• Utilizes internet connectivity for monitoring water level in overhead tank.
• Facilitates motor control based on monitored data.
• Uses NPKan and temperature sensors for water purity and temperature assessment.
• Utilizes LoRa technology for remote monitoring and control.
• Development using embedded C/C++ and Arduino IDE software.

Benefits:
-Identify the system optimizes nutrient supplementation encourages robust crop growth, and maximizes potential output.
-Emphasis on the resource efficiency achieved through remote monitoring and control.
